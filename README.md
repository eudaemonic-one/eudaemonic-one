### Hi there 👋

Hi, I am Rong Cui, currently a Software Development Engineer based in New York, NY.

I read books. I write blogs. I run [Lifelong-Learning](https://github.com/eudaemonic-one/Lifelong-Learning) project.

I’m happy to share what I perceive, think, and learn. Thus, you can see that I’m the eudaemonic one.

- 🔭 I’m currently doing some reading work such as Nonviolent Communication.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Effective Java, Java Concurrency, and Design Patterns.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting distributed file systems projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything after you've read this brilliant article [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
- 📫 How to reach me: my personal [website](https://www.eudaemonic.one/) (blogs, portfolio, bio). 
- 😄 Pronouns: the Eudaemonic One.
- ⚡ Fun fact: eudaemonia == eudemonia == eudaimonia.
