From Pittsburgh, PA. Being eudaemonic everywhere.

Programmer👨🏻‍💻 | Footballer ⚽️ | Railfan 🚂 | Astronomer 🔭 | Tango Amateur 🕺 | Croissant Lover 🥐

Exploiting problem-solving skills. Thinking out loud everyday. On the way toward a tasteful programmer and API designer.

I read books. I write blogs. I run [Lifelong-Learning](https://github.com/eudaemonic-one/Lifelong-Learning) project.

I’m happy to share what I perceive, think, and learn. Thus, you can see that I’m the eudaemonic one.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Effective Java, Java Concurrency, and Design Patterns.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting distributed file systems projects.
